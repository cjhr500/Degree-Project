\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:Introduction}
\section{Motivation}
The cause and evolutionary benefits of menopause is an unsolved problem in biology. 

Menopause unsolved problem in biology -- many different hypotheses and the more research better can help provide evidence for or against each.

Replicating model can be used to check results found elsewhere

Model can be adapted for use for other hypotheses to do with menopause and/or population modelling.

\section{Aims}
To check validity of existing model by replicating it

To rewrite the model into an object oriented language (python)

Address some of it shortcomings (allowing preference to coevolve)

\section{Thesis Outline}
\begin{description}

\item[Chapter Two Literature Review] reviewing past work relevant to the project

\item[Chapter Three Problem Description] looking at what the problem consists of

\item[Chapter Four Design and Implementation] designing a solution to the problem

\item[Chapter Five Results and Evaluation] presenting and analysing the results produced by the solution

\item[Chapter Six Conclusion] making judgement of the solution and the results, suggesting new work.

\end{description}

\section{Statement of Ethics}
Model -- no ethical concerns although eugenics is questionable at best.

\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{cha:Literature Review}
Project is covering computational models of populations to try and understand how menopause might be caused by evolution, therefore it is important to talk about them.

\subsection{Relationship to evolution}

\section{Menopause}
What is menopause. Somatic vs reproductive senescence. Short vs long PRLS.

Which animals has it been show to occur in (Humans, Short Finned Pilot Whales, Orcas (Killer Whales)) Wild vs captive. Human vs Primates.

Possible reasons for menopause Patriarch Hypothesis, Grandmother, reproductive conflict. Overview in \cite{evolutionPRLS2015}

\subsection{Patriarch hypothesis}
Proposed by \cite{patriarchHypothesis2000} , Males having preference for younger females caused menopause

Deterministic model done in \cite{whyMenMatter2007} but this has fixed age of end of reproduction -- something not true now.

Stochastic model done in \cite{mateChoice2013} -- main focus of report. Fixes many of the flaws of \cite{whyMenMatter2007} (including removing the fixed age of the end of reproduction) but still has problems.


\subsection{Grandmother hypothesis}
Grandmothers aid young through knowledge etc

\subsection{Reproductive conflict}
Grandmothers stop reproducing so that their offspring are not competing with their grandchildren for resources. \cite{repConflictOrca2017}

\subsection{Other hypotheses}
Follicular depletion, healthcare/lifespan improvements - not evolutionary but epiphenomenon, Risk from late age reproduction.

\section{Evolution}
Overview \cite{origin1859}

\subsection{Key concepts/terms}
\begin{description}[style=nextline]
\item[Selection] Description of selection

\item [Mutation] Description of mutation

\item [Crossover] Description of crossover

\item [Coevolution] Description of co-evolution
\end{description}


\section{Modelling in biology}


\subsection{Deterministic modelling}
Populations often modelled with exponential growth/differential equations

\subsection{Stochastic modelling}
Multiagent systems, genetic algorithms, neural networks, machine learning to reduce dimensionality,
